# CmsDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8. This is a simple customer management system with basic CRUD operations. 

## Purpose

This project is purly for learning and quick start purpose, like, if you want to introduce Ng2-Redux in your angular projects. Using Ng2-Redux, application state is maintained locally (in-memory). There is no server involved in this demo code. You can just plug your server in using data-service to save state on server side as well.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
